# Kumio: Gamified Digital Heritage Route for Android

This research focuses on the value of gamification in raising digital heritage awareness. We offer two gamified museum experiences in mixed reality: one using a handheld device (Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra tablet) and the other using a wearable device (HoloLens 2). Both versions incorporate game elements to enhance the instructional experience. MRTK 2 Toolkit for HoloLens2 is used for development of this project.

## Key Features:

### Interactive Quest Game: 
Follow a precisely planned route within Yedikule Fortress in Istanbul, designed to maximize historical involvement and learning. Collect hidden coins throughout the fortress to uncover its secrets and solve a final puzzle.
### Educational Quizzes: 
Quizzes are strategically placed along the route to test players on historical knowledge about the sites they visit. These educational quizzes aim to enhance learning without affecting the game's outcome.
### Immersive Diegetic Elements: 
Utilize diegetic elements and historical decorations to add to the immersive experience. These visual and contextual elements help players recall the historical narrative and context of the locations they visit.
